# investigate.vim

A plugin for looking up the documentation of the word under the cursor
based on the current filetype. You can choose to open it in a browser
or with [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) on OS X.

## Configuration

Example mapping:

```
nnoremap <S-k> :call Investigate()<cr>
```

I plan to allow tons of options for configuration for changing URLs,
commands and executables. Some of these already work but since this
plugin is still under heavy development I'm not going to document them
until I think it is ready for a 1.0.0.

## Development

I'd love any pull requests you can muster. Especially the addition of
language specific documentation URLs.
